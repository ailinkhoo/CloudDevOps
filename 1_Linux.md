## Linux Essentials
### Linux Distributions
***Linux*** is a open source and freely distributed operating system. Popular Linux distros are Ubuntu, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, Debian

**Linux distribution** comprises of: 
- **Kernel** 

  It is the framework that connects the application layer to the hardware of a computer. The kernel is the foundation of the operating system which sits directly on     the hardware and permits applications to interact with the hardware and use the hardware as a compute resource.
  
- **GNU core**

  The GNU core utilities are basic file shell and text manipulation utilities of the GNU operating system. They are foundational utilities which are expected to exist   on every operating system. Examples include setting and changing file permissions and ownerships, concatenating, and writing files, giving exit statuses, listing       directories and files, being able to move between directories and files. One of the utilities provided is  
  ```bash
  ls
  ```
  which lists directories.
  
- **X server (optional)**

  This is a framework for the GUI environment or Graphical User Interface. X is an architecture agnostic framework for remote graphical user interfaces and input         devices. 
  
- **Graphical interface (optional)**

  The graphical interface is often referred to as the desktop environment, common Linux desktops include Gnome, KDE, Unity which is what Ubuntu runs here. This is the   environment that permits you to navigate the operating system,
  using a mouse and folders.

All of these run on the hardware (laptop/desktop).


### Embedded Linux

An embedded system is a combination of hardware and software for a purpose. Android, Raspberry Pi, Smart TVs, Networking equipment (routers and switches) are examples of embedded systems.

### Linux in the Cloud

The cloud is a collection of data centers providing compute, application and storage services over the Internet.

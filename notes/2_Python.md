# Getting Started with Python
## REPL 
Python is an interpreted language, and the code is evaluated line-by-line. Since each line can be evaluated by itself, the time between evaluating each line doesnâ€™t matter, and this allows us to have a **REPL**.

**REPL** stands for: Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop 

Each line is read, evaluated, the return value is then printed to the screen, and then the process repeats. 

```python
ailin@Ailin:/mnt/c/Users/Khoo Ai Lin/Desktop/Cloud suport and devops/practice/python$ python3
Python 3.8.2 (default, Mar 13 2020, 10:14:16)
[GCC 9.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 1+ 1
2
>>> None
>>> exit()
```

- access REPL by running `python3` from terminal 
- The `>>>` indicates that you can type on that line. 
- to exit the REPL, `type exit()` or `CTRL+d`
